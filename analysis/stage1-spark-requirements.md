# ðŸ”¥ STAGE 1: SPARK (Requirements Analysis)

## **1. CORE OBJECTIVE:**
Integrate diff-marker functionality as a fourth mode into the existing MultiClip system, providing users with visual diff comparison capabilities alongside clipboard management.

## **2. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- **Existing System:** MultiClip has 3 modes (MultiClip, Orderly, Snippers) with clipboard slot management
- **Pain Points:** No visual comparison tool for text differences within the clipboard system
- **Current Tools:** Users must use external diff tools or manual comparison
- **Business Impact:** Inefficient workflow when comparing clipboard content or file versions
- **Stakeholder Challenges:** Developers and writers need quick diff capabilities integrated with clipboard workflow

## **3. TARGET STATE VISION:**
- **Desired End State:** Seamless diff comparison integrated into MultiClip interface
- **Key Success Metrics:** 
  - Single-click access to diff functionality
  - Visual side-by-side or unified diff views
  - Integration with existing clipboard slots
  - Ability to save diff results to clipboard slots
- **Business Value:** Streamlined text comparison workflow within existing tool
- **User Experience:** Intuitive diff interface matching MultiClip's design language

## **4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

**Core Features (Must Have):**
- Add "Diff-Marker" button next to existing mode buttons (MultiClip, Orderly, Snippers)
- Two-panel text input interface for comparison content
- Visual diff highlighting with color coding (additions, deletions, modifications)
- Load content from clipboard slots into diff panels
- Save diff results back to clipboard slots

**Secondary Features (Should Have):**
- Multiple diff view modes (side-by-side, unified)
- Syntax highlighting for code diffs
- Line number display
- Ignore whitespace options
- Export diff to file

**Future Features (Could Have):**
- File-based diff comparison
- Directory comparison
- Git integration
- Diff history tracking

## **5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Performance:** Real-time diff calculation for texts up to 10,000 lines
- **Security:** Local processing only, no external API calls
- **Usability:** Consistent with existing MultiClip UI patterns
- **Reliability:** Stable diff algorithm with proper error handling
- **Compatibility:** Python tkinter integration with existing codebase

## **6. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- Must use Python tkinter (no npm/web frameworks)
- Integration with existing MultiClip architecture
- Maintain current hotkey system compatibility
- No external dependencies beyond Python standard library + difflib

## **7. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS:**
- **Primary Users:** Developers, writers, content creators using MultiClip
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** System administrators, power users
- **Success Criteria:** Seamless integration without disrupting existing workflows

## **8. RISK ASSESSMENT:**
- **Technical Risks:** UI complexity increase, performance with large texts
- **Mitigation:** Modular design, lazy loading, text size limits
- **Business Risks:** Feature creep, user confusion
- **Contingencies:** Simple initial implementation, progressive enhancement

## **9. PROJECT SCOPE:**

**In Scope:**
- Diff-Marker mode button and interface
- Basic text comparison functionality
- Integration with clipboard slots
- Visual diff highlighting

**Out of Scope:**
- File system integration (Phase 2)
- Advanced diff algorithms beyond difflib
- Network-based comparison features

## **10. SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Diff-Marker button appears and functions correctly
- Users can compare text from clipboard slots
- Visual diff output is clear and actionable
- No disruption to existing MultiClip functionality
