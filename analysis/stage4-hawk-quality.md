# ðŸ¦… STAGE 4: HAWK (Quality Assurance)

## **1. TESTING STRATEGY:**

**Unit Testing Plan:**
```python
# Test cases for diff functionality
describe('DiffManager', () => {
  test('should calculate basic text differences', async () => {
    const diff_manager = new DiffManager()
    const result = diff_manager.calculate_diff("hello\nworld", "hello\nplanet")
    assert(result.stats.modifications > 0)
  });
  
  test('should handle empty text inputs', async () => {
    const diff_manager = new DiffManager()
    const result = diff_manager.calculate_diff("", "")
    assert(result.stats.total_lines === 0)
  });
  
  test('should respect text size limits', async () => {
    const diff_manager = new DiffManager()
    const large_text = "x".repeat(2000000)
    expect(() => diff_manager.calculate_diff(large_text, "")).toThrow()
  });
});
```

**Integration Testing Plan:**
- UI component integration with clipboard manager
- Diff interface integration with main window
- Mode switching functionality validation
- Clipboard slot loading/saving integration

**End-to-End Testing Plan:**
- Complete diff workflow from text input to result display
- Integration with existing MultiClip modes
- Hotkey functionality preservation
- UI responsiveness during large diff operations

## **2. SECURITY VALIDATION:**

**Input Validation:**
- [ ] Text size limits enforced (1MB maximum)
- [ ] Encoding validation for text inputs
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during diff operations
- [ ] Protection against malformed text input

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] Local processing only - no external API calls
- [ ] Clipboard content remains private
- [ ] No temporary file creation for diff operations
- [ ] Memory cleanup after diff calculations

## **3. PERFORMANCE TESTING:**

**Load Testing Requirements:**
- Text comparison up to 10,000 lines
- UI responsiveness during diff calculation
- Memory usage under 100MB for large diffs
- Response time <2 seconds for typical comparisons

**Stress Testing Scenarios:**
- Maximum text size handling (1MB)
- Rapid mode switching
- Multiple diff operations in sequence
- UI stability during background processing

## **4. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:**

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Consistent with existing MultiClip architecture
- [ ] Proper error handling in all diff operations
- [ ] UI components follow tkinter best practices
- [ ] Memory management for large text processing
- [ ] Thread safety for background operations

**Static Analysis Results:**
- Code coverage target: >85%
- No circular dependencies between modules
- Proper separation of concerns (UI/Logic/Data)
- Consistent naming conventions

## **5. PRODUCTION READINESS CHECKLIST:**

**Integration Validation:**
- [ ] Diff-Marker button appears correctly
- [ ] Mode switching preserves existing functionality
- [ ] Clipboard manager integration working
- [ ] No conflicts with existing hotkeys
- [ ] UI layout remains consistent

**Configuration Management:**
- [ ] No additional dependencies required
- [ ] Existing configuration files unchanged
- [ ] New diff preferences properly stored
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## **6. MONITORING & ALERTING SETUP:**

**Application Monitoring:**
```yaml
# Performance metrics to track
metrics:
  - diff_calculation_time < 2000ms
  - memory_usage < 100MB
  - ui_response_time < 100ms
  - error_rate < 0.1%

alerts:
  - critical: memory_usage > 200MB
  - warning: diff_calculation_time > 5000ms
  - info: mode_switched_to_diff_marker
```

**Error Tracking:**
- Exception handling for diff calculation failures
- UI error state management
- Graceful degradation for large text inputs
- User feedback for operation status
