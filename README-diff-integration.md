# MultiClip Diff-Marker Integration

## Overview
This integration adds a fourth mode "Diff-Marker" to the existing MultiClip system, providing visual text comparison capabilities alongside clipboard management.

## Implementation Summary

### New Components Added:
1. **diff_marker/** - New module directory
   - `diff_manager.py` - Core diff calculation logic
   - `diff_interface.py` - UI component for diff operations
   - `diff_types.py` - Data structures for diff results

2. **Enhanced Components:**
   - `gui/main_window.py` - Added Diff-Marker mode button and panel
   - `multiclip.py` - Integrated clipboard manager with diff interface

### Key Features:
- **Two-panel text input** for comparison content
- **Visual diff highlighting** with color coding
- **Multiple view modes** (side-by-side, unified)
- **Clipboard slot integration** - load from and save to slots
- **Real-time diff calculation** using Python's difflib
- **Performance optimized** for texts up to 1MB

### Integration Points:
- Seamless mode switching with existing MultiClip, Orderly, and Snippers
- Shared clipboard manager for consistent data access
- Consistent UI design language and user experience
- No disruption to existing hotkey functionality

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Access Diff-Marker**: Click the "Diff-Marker" button in the top toolbar
2. **Input Text**: Use the two-panel interface to enter or load text for comparison
3. **Load from Slots**: Use "Load from Slot" buttons to pull content from clipboard slots
4. **Compare**: Click "Compare" to generate visual diff
5. **View Results**: Switch between side-by-side and unified diff views
6. **Save Results**: Save diff output back to clipboard slots for later use

## Technical Architecture:

The integration follows the existing MultiClip architecture patterns:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- tkinter-based UI consistent with existing interface
- Integration with shared clipboard manager
- Local processing with no external dependencies

## Quality Assurance:

- **Performance**: Handles large texts efficiently with size limits
- **Security**: Local processing only, no data transmission
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface matching MultiClip design patterns

This integration enhances MultiClip's utility for developers, writers, and content creators who need quick text comparison capabilities within their clipboard workflow.
